# FURNI-endpoint

The Furni-endpoint allows you to get the latest Habbo Furniture. You will get all the info on the furni, we have. Stuff like icons, descriptions and much more. You can even rotate the furni and in the future, hopefully see animations.

Read the **[get.md](get.md)** file for more information.
